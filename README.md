# Lambda in Private VPC

**Status:** Work in Progress

This project shows how to build a highly available system that runs in multiple AWS regions at the same time. It uses AWS Resilience Hub to ensure compliance with policies for Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), which help to minimize downtime and data loss in case of failures at the application, availability zone, or region level. This ensures high availability and fault tolerance for your applications.

## CloudFormation Templates

The project includes several AWS CloudFormation templates that automate the creation and management of the necessary AWS resources:

- `app.yml`: This template sets up an application named "lambda-vpc" with a ResilienceHub ResiliencyPolicy. The application includes AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway Rest APIs, and DynamoDB Global Tables.
- `disaster-recovery.yml`: This template sets up a disaster recovery test using AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS). The experiments include denying access to Lambda on API Gateway, deleting a DynamoDB table, and recovering a DynamoDB table from a point-in-time recovery (PITR) or a backup.
- `template.yml`: This template deploys a Lambda function in a private VPC with internet access. The function can access resources in the VPC and make outbound calls to the internet.
- `route53.yml`: This template sets up DNS records in Amazon Route 53 for two API Gateway Rest APIs. The DNS records are configured for failover routing, which means that if one API becomes unavailable, traffic will be routed to the other API.
